#  Nashville Housing Data Cleaning
## Task
* In this project, I cleaned a public database on Nashville house sales. I used MSSQL to execute queries that standardized dates, populated missing data, split data into new columns, removed duplicates, and removed unnecessary columns.
## Tools
* Microsoft SQL Server 2019 for data analysis - [SQL scripts](https://github.com/MayaClarke/nashville_housing_data/blob/main/nashville_housing_data_cleaning.sql)
